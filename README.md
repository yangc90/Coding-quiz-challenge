# Coding-quiz-challenge
This challenge was to create a coding quiz challenge where the user would be able to play a multiple choice game. When questions are answered incorrectly time gets docked from timer as well as showing the user if the choice selected was correct. At the end of the game the user is able to see their score, type in their initials and keep their score in the highscores page.
